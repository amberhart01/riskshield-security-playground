\f0\fs24 \cf0 Company Policy Document\
=======================\
\
Asset Management:\
-----------------\
Our company maintains an accurate and up-to-date inventory of all hardware assets, including computers, servers, and mobile devices. However, our software asset inventory is only updated on an annual basis. While hardware tracking is automated, software inventory records sometimes lag behind due to manual updates.\
\
Risk Assessment:\
----------------\
We conduct a comprehensive risk assessment once every two years. Our process includes the identification of potential risks and documentation of mitigation strategies. That said, the frequency of our reviews sometimes fails to keep pace with rapid changes in the business environment, leaving some emerging risks under-addressed.\
\
Access Control:\
---------------\
Access to our systems is governed by strict role-based controls. Employees must request access via our secure portal and receive approval from their supervisors. In practice, while account creation and initial permissions are tightly controlled, periodic reviews of user privileges are inconsistently enforced. As a result, some user accounts retain access even after role changes or departures.\
\
Awareness and Training:\
-----------------------\
All new hires undergo mandatory security training during onboarding, and refresher sessions are scheduled every three years. The training materials include industry best practices. However, we do not currently have a robust process for measuring training effectiveness, meaning that comprehension and adherence to these practices are not formally assessed.\
\
Security Continuous Monitoring:\
-------------------------------\
Our IT systems are monitored 24/7 through an automated system that is designed to provide timely alerts when deviations from established baseline activities occur. While most critical alerts are promptly addressed, there have been instances of manual oversight where some alerts were not acted upon quickly enough.\
